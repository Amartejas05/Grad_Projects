Successfully designed and implemented a distributed file system using socket programming in Python
• Used multithreading in the server to handle multiple concurrent clients
• Used WatchDogAPI to constantly monitor a designated directory on client side in-order to detect changes in the directory.
• Ensured file consistency by updating the files on all the client’s directory even if one modifies the content at any point of
time.
• Implemented two phase commits to ensure either all the clients do a particular operation or none of them will perform.
• Built a GUI for server and client using Pysimple GUI
